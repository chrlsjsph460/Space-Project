## Description
Project Motivation: I enjoy playing basketball. It's hard to determine the effect of defense. For example, someone tall can cause you to alter your shot just by being near you. When I played pickup basketball in Cleveland, there was a law student, Nick, with excellent shooting skills. It was very hard to make him miss. You would have to really get in his space to throw him off. So, I was curious about the effect of space on professional basketball players. This is my humble attempt of getting some insights from NBA data using basic linear regression analysis.
